questions 56 through 58 refer to the following conversation I have an idea what if our company started subsidizing employee education we could offer financial support for workers who want to pursue professional courses I don't see why not many successful corporations invest in stock development and based on last Friday's gathering with the board of directors of a company has enough money and its budget to do the same so then how much of the education costs do you think we should cover the best way to determine that is to look into the amounts but other similar companies normally provide please do some research and let me know what you find number 56 what does the man suggest
