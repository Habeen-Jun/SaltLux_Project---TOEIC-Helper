Question 68 through 70 refer to the following conversation and flight schedule and we wanted to catch a connecting flight to add destination. Wait, look here. This screen says our flight has been delayed. I'd like to find a spot in this terminal that provides Wi-Fi. I need to download the lecture notes from the sales conference. We attended in Cincinnati OH, you know, there's a charge to use the airport's internet service. Really? I'd rather not pay your fate will I should still have time to review the notes before around noon meeting today in Portland? Miss. Anderson probably won't ask as much about the conference. Anyway, she'll be more interested in whether we secured any sales contracts on our trip.Number 68. Why is the man worried? Number 69. What does the man want to do? Number 70 look at the graphic which flight will the speakers take?
