Questions 68 70 refer to the following conversation and flight schedule.
Let’s hurry, Kelsey. I’m concerned we won’t catch our connecting flight to our destination.
Wait look here. This screen says our flight has been delayed.
Yeah, you’re right. In that case, I’d like to find a spot in this terminal that provides Wi Fi. I need to download the lecture notes from the sales conference we attended in Cincinnati.
Just so you know, there’s a charge to use the airport’s Internet service.
Really? I’d rather not pay a fee. Well, I should still have time to review the notes before our noon meeting today in Portland.
Yeah. Ms. Anderson probably won’t ask us much about the conference anyway. She’ll be more interested in whether we secured any sales contracts on our trip.
